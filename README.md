# Human_Resources_Dataset


## Objective

In this project, I am tasked to predict why employees are leaving the firm in order to receive my Google Data Analytics certification Here's a rundown of what I've done:
1. Getting the data via Kaggle, and loading it in Google Colab (so I can access it on multiple devices).
2. Seeing what needs to be done (data cleaning, wrangling, etc).
3. I implemented some Explotarory Data analysis in order to see which variables to investigate for my statistical analysis. 
4. I then used statistical techniques such as ANOVA, regression, and others to answer why are various employees leaving the firm.
5. I later used different machine-learning techniques to predict the question and investigate more.
