# Human_Resources_Dataset


## Objective

In this project, I am tasked to predict why are employees leaving the firm in order to recive my Google Data Analytics certification Here's a rundown of what I've done:
1. Getting the data via Kaggle, and loading it in Google Colab (so I can access it on multiple devices).
2. Seeing what needs to be done (data cleanging, wrangling, and etc).
3. I implemented some Explotarory Data analysis in order to see which variables to investigate for my stastistical analyis. 
4. I then used statistical techniques such as ANOVA, regression, and others to answer why are various employees leaving the firm.
5. I later used different machine-learning techniques to predict the question and investigate more.

## Dataset

I've used a dataset that I've found in Kaggle. I was unable to extract the JSON file from the Pokemon.apk website, nor do data mining from a wiki page or another website containing all Pokemon. 

More info about the dataset can be found here:

## Discovery

Here is a small conclusion that I've found based on my findings:
